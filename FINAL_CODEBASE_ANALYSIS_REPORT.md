## 1. Database Schema Analysis

### Schema Overview

The database contains **16 tables** organized around a service booking platform with comprehensive relationship management.

#### Core Tables Structure

```
users (auth) → customerProfiles / professionalProfiles (1:1)
professions → services (1:many)
professionalProfiles ↔ services (many-to-many via professionalServices)
services ↔ categories (many-to-many via serviceCategories)
services ↔ tags (many-to-many via serviceTags)
bookings → all entities (central booking management)
```

#### Key Features

- **User Type System**: Clean separation between customers and professionals
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Comprehensive RBAC with user-role assignments
- **Audit Trail**: Multiple audit mechanisms (auditLogs, bookingStatusHistory)
- **Flexible Categorization**: Both categories and tags for service classification
- **Soft Deletion**: Consistent `isActive` flags across entities

#### Schema Strengths

1. **Well-Structured Relationships**: Proper foreign keys with cascade policies
2. **Modern TypeScript Integration**: Excellent Drizzle ORM usage with type inference
3. **Comprehensive Validation**: Zod schema generation for all entities
4. **UUID Strategy**: Consistent use for user-facing entities
5. **Data Integrity**: Extensive constraints and unique indexes

#### Areas for Consideration

- **Mixed Data Types**: Some varchar fields could be enums
- **Availability Complexity**: The availability system suggests more complex scheduling not fully defined
- **Review Constraints**: No constraints preventing multiple reviews per booking
